# AntlrCompiler

> **Educational Compiler Project** â€” a full-stack implementation of a programming language, from grammar to execution.

This project demonstrates the **complete development cycle of a simple compiler**:
- **Lexer & Parser generation** (ANTLR 4)
- **Type checking** (custom visitor pattern)
- **Stack-based intermediate code generation**
- **Virtual Machine (interpreter)** for executing the generated code

Built entirely in **Java 17** with **Maven**.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Summary

This project simulates the process of creating a simple stack-based programming language from scratch. It showcases important concepts in compiler construction:

- Language design (tokens, syntax rules)
- Syntax analysis (parsing, AST construction)
- Semantic analysis (type checking, symbol tables)
- Intermediate representation (stack-based instructions)
- Code generation (output to `.out` file)
- Program execution (via a custom **StackMachine** interpreter)

**Main steps:**
1. **Parsing** the source code using ANTLR.
2. **Type Checking** with detailed error reporting.
3. **Code Generation** into stack-based instructions.
4. **Execution** on a custom stack-based Virtual Machine.

## ðŸ§  Features

This compiler project supports a rich subset of imperative programming features:

* **Typed language design**

  Includes primitive types: `int`, `float`, `bool`, `string`, and `file`.
  Supports automatic promotion from `int` to `float` in expressions.

* **Comprehensive expression support**

  Arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`), logical (`&&`, `||`, `!`), comparison (`<`, `>`, `==`, `!=`), string concatenation (`.`), and file append (`<<`) operators are available with correct precedence and associativity.

* **Statements and control flow**

  Includes variable declarations, assignments, input/output (`read`, `write`), and structured control flow via `if`, `else`, `while`, and `for`.

* **Block scoping and semantic validation**

  Uses a symbol table and static type checker to ensure correctness at compile time, with meaningful error messages and line references.

* **File I/O system**

  The `file` type allows working with files using simple, expressive syntax:

  * `f = open("file.txt", "w");` to overwrite, or `"a"` to append
  * `f << "data" << 123;` to chain file output
    These are compiled into stack-based instructions (`push`, `fwrite`, `fappend N`).

* **Intermediate representation and VM**

  Generates stack-based code with a minimal instruction set. The virtual machine executes the code by interpreting instructions like `push`, `load`, `save`, `fappend`, `print`, `jmp`, and more.

* **Modular and extensible architecture**

  Clean separation between the parser, type checker, code generator, and VM makes it easy to add new features, types, or constructs.

## ðŸ“„ Language Specification (Mini-Lang)

**Data types**: `int`, `float`, `bool`, `string`, `file`

**Statements**:
* Variable declarations
* Assignments
* Input/Output (`read`, `write`)
* File I/O:
  * `file f;`
  * `f = open("filename.txt", "w" | "a");`
  * `f << "some text" << 123;`
* Control flow (`if`, `else`, `while`, `for`)
* Blocks (`{ ... }`)
* Empty statements (`;`)

**Expressions**:
* Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
* Logical: `&&`, `||`, `!`
* Comparison: `<`, `>`, `==`, `!=`
* String concatenation: `.`
* File appending: `<<`
* Type coercion: automatic int â†’ float

**Comments**: `// single line comment`

## ðŸ“š Example

```c
file f;
f = open("log.txt", "a");
f << "Session started: " << 2025;

int i;
i = 0;
while (i < 3) {
    f << "Line " << i;
    i = i + 1;
}
```

This example appends multiple lines to the file `log.txt`, demonstrating file declaration, opening, appending data, and control flow.

## ðŸš€ How to Build and Run

### Prerequisites 

* Java 17 or higher
* Maven 3.x
* ANTLR plugin (automatically handled by Maven)

### Build the Project 

In the root directory of the project, run:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

This compiles the project, generates ANTLR classes, and builds the `.jar`.

### Run a Program 

To compile and execute a `.lang` source file:

```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=cz.university.App 
```
For PowerShell:

```powershell
mvn exec:java "-Dexec.mainClass=cz.university.App" 
```

This will:

1. Parse the input file.
2. Type-check it.
3. Generate stack-based instructions into `output.out`.
4. Execute the program via the built-in virtual machine.

### Run Unit Tests 

To run the included JUnit tests:

```bash
mvn test
```

Test cases are defined in `AppTest.java`, including validation of code generation and file operations.
